## Search in packman
This is a lab of [Udacity Artificial Intelligence Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/ai) course of searching in Pac-Man game.  
The Lab has been created by the UC Berkeley AI division and its detailed description can be found 
[here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa10/projects/search/search.html).  
I implemented required tasks in search.py and searchAgents.py except the optional task of the approximate search agent.
